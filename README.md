This is a fork from oxpig/ANARCI. 

This fork modifies a few files to add support for Windows 10.

Thanks oxpig for sharing such good tools.

The following steps worked on Windows 10 and anaconda3:
1. Install muscle and hmmer Windows executables, and add them in PATH.
2. conda install Biopython
3. python setup.py install
